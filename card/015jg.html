		<h1 class="fancy">Thank You Jen and Michelle!</h1>
		
		<p>We're so grateful for the nursing scarf, baby basics, and the hooded bath towel that you gifted us! We look forward to watching our son hop out the bath and run around the house wearing his towel as a cape while he gets the floor sopping wet.</p>
		
		<p>Michelle, you were missed and we look forward to seeing you soon! Jen, thank you for coming to our baby shower and celebrating the arrival of our baby boy!</p>
		
		<p>Love,</p>
		
		<p class="fancy">Natalie and Eddie</p>
