		<h1 class="fancy">Thank You Mom!</h1>
		
		<p>We're so grateful for the crib and accompanying accessories, the handmade quilt, and the stuffed animals that you gifted us! Our son is sure to snuggle up under his quilt while sleeping in his crib for many years to come.</p>
		
		<p>Thank you for hosting the baby shower, the event was amazing and exactly how we envisioned it, and thank you for  celebrating the arrival of our baby boy!</p>
		
		<p>Love,</p>
