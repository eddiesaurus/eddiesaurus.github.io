		<p>We're so grateful for the baby bottles and bathtub that you gifted us! We look forward to watching our son splash around in the tub and we're excited to learn the bottle combination that he likes best.</p>
		
		<p>You were both missed at the party and we look forward to seeing you two soon! Thank you for celebrating the arrival of our baby boy!</p>
		
		<p>Love,</p>
