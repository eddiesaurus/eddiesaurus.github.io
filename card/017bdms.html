		<h1 class="fancy">Thank You Bethany, Den, Michelle, and Sarah!</h1>
		
		<p>We're so grateful for the bassinet, accessories and crochet blanket that you gifted us! We'll definitely need to use the net to prevent our ever curious and demanding cats from sleeping atop the blanket in the baby's bassinet!</p>
		
		<p>Thank you all for your continued friendship and support and get ready for some baby photo spam in the near future. Thank you for celebrating the arrival of our baby boy!</p>
		
		<p>Love,</p>
		
		<p class="fancy">Natalie and Eddie</p>
