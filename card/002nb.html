		<h1 class="fancy">Thank You Neil and Mike!</h1>
		
		<p>We're so grateful for the playmat, stuffed animals, and cash that you gifted us! We look forward to watching out son kick around to make music on his colorful playmat. We're also happy that you continued our childhood tradition by gifting a stuffed tiger to our son.</p>
		
		<p>Thank you for all your help with the baby shower and thank you for celebrating the arrival of our baby boy!</p>
		
		<p>Love,</p>
