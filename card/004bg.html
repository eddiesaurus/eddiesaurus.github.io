		<h1 class="fancy">Thank You Mom and Justice!</h1>
		
		<p>We're so grateful for the baby wrap carrier, the nail file set, and the nasal aspirator that you gifted us! We're excited to wrap our son and carry him around like a kangaroo everywhere we go. We've heard great things about the nail file and are sure to clear out a lot of his boogies with the nasal aspirator.</p>
		
		<p>Thank you for coming to our baby shower and celebrating the arrival of our baby boy!</p>
		
		<p>Love,</p>
		
		<p class="fancy">Eddie and Natalie</p>
