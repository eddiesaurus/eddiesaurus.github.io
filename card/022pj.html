		<p>We're so grateful for the diaper bag that you gifted us. We look forward to packing the bag full of all the things that we need to take care of baby while we go on outings. We also look forward to transforming the bag into a bassinet whenever we settle down for a rest!</p>
		
		<p>Thank you for the congratulations and for celebrating the arrival of our baby boy!</p>
		
		<p>Love,</p>
