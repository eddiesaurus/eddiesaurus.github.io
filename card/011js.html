		<h1 class="fancy">Thank You Jim and Katie!</h1>
		
		<p>We're so grateful for the shampoo and the playpen that you gifted us! We look forward to watching our son crawl around the playpen and eventually grow big enough to try and climb out of it!</p>
		
		<p>Katie, you were missed and we look forward to seeing you soon! Jim, thank you for coming to our baby shower and celebrating the arrival of our baby boy!</p>
		
		<p>Love,</p>
