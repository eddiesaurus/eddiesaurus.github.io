		<h1 class="fancy">Thank You Tina and Mike!</h1>
		
		<p>We're so grateful for the clothing, the book, the teethers, and the Haakaa pump let down collector that you gifted us! Natalie is very happy to know that she won't have to fight Eddie on the burlap sack <i>issue</i> now that baby has all of these adorable clothes to wear.</p>
		
		<p>Thank you for coming to our baby shower and celebrating the arrival of our baby boy!</p>
		
		<p>Love,</p>
